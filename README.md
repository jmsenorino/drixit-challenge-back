# Drixit Challenge: Back-End

Thank you so much for the patience and all the help!

## To run the Back:

`npm install` will install all dependencies.\
`npm start` will run on port 3001. (Should log "Database Connected")

## Implemented Libraries:

### Bcryptjs

Used to encrypt the passwords so I would not save it raw in the DB

### Dotenv

Used to have a .env file in witch i could protect security-related data.\
Just for the Challenge, I decided to include the .env in the repository so you could see that too

### Express & Cors

Framework form my server-side logic

### Jsonwebtoken

To handle Web Tokens

### Mongoose

Used for object modeling and connection to MongoDB

### Rest

I used to test the http request. I decided to not include it on the .gitignore and DevDependencies so you can see that too.
